# Capturing Molecular Interactions in Graph Neural Networks: A Case Study in Multi-Component Phase Equilibrium (SolvGNN)

## âœ¨ Introduction

Here, we propose a **solvent GNN (SolvGNN)** architecture that captures molecular interactions in an explicit manner by combining *atomic-level (local)* graph convolution and *molecular-level (global)* message passing through a molecular interaction network. SolvGNN uses a graph representation wherein each node represents a molecule and each edge represents a potential intermolecular interaction (e.g., hydrogen bonding). We tested SolvGNN via a case study on **activity coefficient predictions for binary and ternary mixtures** using large data sets obtained from **COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvation (COSMO-RS)** calculations. We show that the proposed SolvGNN can predict composition-dependent activity coefficients with high accuracy. To interpret the trained model, we performed **counterfactual analysis** on SolvGNN to highlight the physical implications of chemical structures and compositions on the solvation behavior. Finally, we built a SolvGNN-based framework that takes a given mixture (binary or ternary) as input and generates the corresponding **phase diagrams (P-x-y)** using predicted activity coefficients coupled with phase equilibrium calculations.

SolvGNN is an open-source **computational framework and tool**. It can be directly used as tools to predict activity coefficients and/or generate phase diagrams; it can also be used for researchers and developers to train their own data sets and initiate future research.
